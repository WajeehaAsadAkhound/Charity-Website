                The idea of rain water harvesting comes from the ideato take advantage from the free resource, to capture the free water falling on our roofs. We take initiative of rain water harvesting system because we believe that it is very useful technology and play 
                a vital role in development of our societies, city and country. Basically, Rain water harvesting starts from collecting rain water from the roofs. Then implement a storage system like barrels, tanks at the downspout of your roof gutter system.
                The rain water is channeled into gutters, then into the downspout and finally in the barrels. The water in the storage system should pass through filtration system to remove and make sure that their will be no any harmful remaining pieces. 
                Harvested water can be used for various purposes like washing machine, garden irrigation and even for non potable uses around the house. By implememting harvesting system you can take control of your water supply and replace generous portion of your water needs.
